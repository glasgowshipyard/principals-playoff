# Principles Playoff

**Tournament-style elimination to discover what actually drives us**

A head to head of guiding principles.

## What It Does

Principles Playoff helps you discover your core guiding principles through a familiar March Madness-style tournament. You'll face impossible choices, revealing what truly matters when you can't have everything.

- **30 Core Principles** across 6 fundamental human drives
- **Custom Principles** - add your own to any category
- **Tournament Elimination** - familiar bracket format forces real trade-offs
- **Personal Analysis** - understand your decision-making profile
- **Organizational Alignment** - see where you might find friction (optional)
- **Professional Reports** - branded PDF export for teams and coaches

## Why It Matters

Most people have never honestly ranked their priorities. When "family" and "career advancement" compete head-to-head, which actually wins? When "looking good" faces "peak performance," what do you really choose?

This tool forces those uncomfortable decisions, revealing the difference between what you think drives you and what actually does.

## The Six Categories

### Achievement/Mastery
Excellence, improvement, pushing limits, measuring progress

### Autonomy  
Independence, self-determination, freedom from external control

### Security
Stability, safety, financial security, preparedness

### Service/Contribution
Making an impact, serving others, leaving things better

### Relationships/Connection
Family, loyalty, deep bonds, community ties

### Health/Vitality
Physical capability, appearance, performance, longevity
